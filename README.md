## Development

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wearevero/fiber.git
cd fiber
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

First, make sure all Go dependencies are up to date:

```bash
go mod tidy
```

### 3. Install Air for Hot Reloading

Air is used for automatic reloading during development. Install it using the following command:

```bash
go install github.com/cosmtrek/air@latest
```

### 4. Run the Project

Once everything is set up, you can run the project using Air:

```bash
air
```

This will start the server, and it will automatically restart whenever there are changes to the source code, making development faster and more efficient.
